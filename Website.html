                    Let’s inspire our children with the values, attitudes and attributes,
                    for them to be confident with their sense of purpose and identity;

                <p>   
                    and let’s equip them with the knowledge, skills and aspirations
                    for them to transform themselves and the society,
                    to successfully meet the challenges of their generation, and beyond.

                    Learning through nature and through nurture: the dedicated Nature Areas at the North Campus for the Pre Primary
                    (Playgroup, Pre-nursery, Nursery and Kindergarten) and Elementary Section (Grades I & II) have been phenomenal in
                    bringing children closer to nature.
                    
                    It is creating a big difference in their appreciation and hence, love for nature. Students are immersed in hands-on
                    experiential learning and inspiration through the elements of nature; from sun and sand to wood and water.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The emphasis on sports and fitness channels the learners’ energies towards healthy competition and teamwork – all based
                    on strong fundamentals of focus, discipline and skills. This helps develop a positive attitude towards failures – as
                    well as successes.
                    
                    Beyond the many inter-school sports competitions and achievements, the highlights every year are often the Annual Sports
                    & olympiads, which bring together students, teachers, parents and guests in a display of mastery over skills, and strong
                    values that have come to define Generation’s School.  </p>
